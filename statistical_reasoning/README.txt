"You  are  a  data  analyst  working  for  a multinational  company (ABC) with  4,600  employees  with  multiple departments,
 including  Sales,  Marketing,  Finance,  and  Human  Resources.  The  company  is interested in understanding the factors
 that influence employee concerns, such as (but not limited to)  compensation,  motivation  and  career  progression.
 The  leadership  team  has  asked  you  to conduct a statistical analysis to uncover any potential insights. *Bring

Potential reasons for ABC in understanding factors related to employee concerns:
- Employee Retention & Talent Acquisition
- Employee Productivity & Engagement
- (Which in turn leads to) Long Term Growth & Strategic Success

How do we model factors that influence employee concerns? Look at factors influencing satisfaction levels of employees!
- Current benefits: Salary, CPF contributions, compensations etc.

Indicators of current employee sentiments:
- Age distribution of employees: A younger company potentially indicates "turn-over" & an older company potentially
  indicates "traditional leadership" (need for change?)
- Marital status: Is the company "family-friendly"? Etc.
- No. of years served in company: What is the distribution? ***
- No. of dependents vs compensation (come out with metrics).
